     <li>Set up a "dredging station" to minimize mess and make cleanup easy. Put your ingredients and mixtures into large shallow bowls or baking dishes. Then work in one direction (left to right, for example), moving from seasoned flour to egg batter over to bread crumbs/panko/coating mixture. This dry-wet-dry method helps the ingredients stick to the chicken pieces.</li>
     <li>Have one "wet hand" and one "dry hand" -- and use your "wet" hand to transfer chicken from the wet mixture to the coating bowl.</li>

     <li>Before easing the coated chicken pieces into hot fat, allow them to rest, which will give the coating a chance to adhere. Do this step in the refrigerator if you won't be frying the chicken within half an hour. </li>
